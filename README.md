## 🔍 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity specialist and data engineer passionate about bridging the gap between security, compliance, and business insights. With a strong foundation in NIST, ISO 27001, SOC, SOX, and cloud security, I thrive in roles that demand both technical depth and strategic GRC alignment.

From securing university systems at UCF to auditing IT infrastructure in the Middle East, I bring a hybrid background of IT audit, data analytics, and access control engineering—wrapped in clear documentation and sharp reports.
